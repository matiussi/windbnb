## Overview

### Screenshot

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/RDjR7gA.png)

My main goal building this project was learning and testing some features of Vue.js. So... You may find some unnecessary code, like using Vuex store to filter 4 cities :)

- [Live demo](https://matiussi-windbnb.netlify.app/)
- The project itself was very interesting to build, I used to recreate the design from images, like in Frontendmentor.io, using Figma made my development process faster. I also could easily implement all the functionalities using the Vue directives
- I could learn the Vue.js framework and Vuex


### Built With

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)


## Features

#### Basic
- Users can see a list of properties
- Users can see the property card with a name, rating, apartment type, and super host
- Users can open the filter drawer

#### Extra
- Users can filter the properties by typing the city or country
